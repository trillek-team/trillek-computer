<h1>Greetings and Salutations!</h1>

<p>
Allow me to introduce Project Trillek, a game inspired by Notch's 0x10c.
</p>
<p>
This effort is not a buildup from the now-indefinitely delayed 0x10c, but 
instead a reimagining of that Sci-fi sandbox. Armed with your trusty ship, its 
TR3200-based control system and a weapon or six, you too can set out to explore 
the Universe in a way few have ever dared to attempt. Only you can forge your 
destiny in Trillek's brave new world.
</p>
<p>
We're dedicated to creating a fun, challenging game that you control. From 
ordering your crew to prepare for FTL, to exploring the surface of some 
randomly-generated planet in hopes of finding evidence of a civilization long 
forgotten, to being chased down the halls of your own ship by an alien menace, 
other traders beating you to market, or even taking the fight to your fellow 
man before watching your ship be ripped apart while you float away in an escape
pod.
</p>
<p>
This will be an epic journey in Open Source (and open space). We hope you'll 
enjoy the end result. But we need your help! This project comes from the 
Community, for the Community, and we welcome your feedback and participation as
we create the ultimate space simulator.
