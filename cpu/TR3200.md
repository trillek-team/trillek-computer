TR3200 (Trillek Risc cpu 32 00) Specification
====================================
Version 0.10 (WIP) 


SUMMARY
=======

 * 32 bit RISC CPU
 * 11 general purpose registers (%r0 to %r10)
 * Multiplication/Quotient register (%y)
 * Base Pointer (%bp) and Stack Pointer (%sp) 
 * Flags/Enable bits Register (%flags)
 * Interrupt Address (%ia)
 * Little Endian

In this document, anything within [brackets] is shorthand for 
"the value of the RAM at the location of the value inside the brackets". 
For example, %sp register is "stack pointer", but [%sp] means the value of the RAM 
at the location the stack pointer is pointing. Also in the notation we will use
BYTES for 8 bit values, WORDS for 16 bit values and DWORDs for 32 bit values. 

The TR3200 instruction set is based in 32 bit dwords, so each time that the PC 
is incremented, is incremented by four. Also is Little Endian, so the MSB of a 
word or dword is stored in the lowest address, and the LSB is stored in the 
highest address.

Whenever the CPU needs to read a instruction, it reads [PC], then increases PC
by four as a instruction uses dword. Shorthand for this is [PC+4]. In some 
cases, the CPU will modify a value before reading it, in this case the 
shorthand is [++X]. When we say that the TR3200 Push a value to the Stack, 
writes these value at [--%sp]. When we say that TR3200 Pops a value from the 
stack, reads a value from [%sp++]. Remember that we work with 32 bit values in
Little Endian, so to store a value in the stack, we need to push each byte of 
the dword value.

Also the internal architecture is a not pipelined 3 stages (FETCH, DECODE,
EXECUTE), So the majority of instructions need only 3 cycles 
to be fully executed. there are exceptions like multiplication, ram/stack instructions, etc that uses the EXECUTE stage multiples times and will need extra cycles to be fully executed.

Advice, if the CPU access to an address that isn't a multiply of 4, then will 
take one cycle more to access to these address of RAM. Code must be aligned to 4 byte boundary.


Registers :
 
  - %r0 .. %r10 - General Purpose Registers (GPR)
  - %r11 - %y - Multiplication/Rest register
  - %r12 - %bp - Base Pointer  -> Use as pointer to the local frame in the stack  
  - %r13 - %sp - Stack Pointer -> Points to the last value Pushed in the stack
  - %r14 - %ia - Interrupt Address
  - %r15 - %flags - Flags/Enable bits register
  - PC - Program Counter  

FLAGS register :

  - BIT 31-10-> Reserved
  - BIT 9    -> ENABLE SINGLE-STEP MODE (ESS)
  - BIT 8    -> ENABLE INTERRUPT (EI)
  - BIT 4-7  -> Reserved
  - BIT 3    -> INTERRUPT FLAG: 1 If an interrupt is happening. (IF)
  - BIT 2    -> DIVISION ERROR FLAG: 1 If was a division error. (DE)
  - BIT 1    -> OVERFLOW FLAG: 1 If an arithmetic operation overflowed. (OF)
  - BIT 0    -> CARRY FLAG: 1 If the last ADDx/SUBx carried or borrowed a bit. (CF)

If ESS bit is enable, the TR3200 will generate an appropriated interrupt with message 0.

[![FLAGS Register Diagram](img/dia/FLAGS_format.png "FlagsRegisterDia")](img/dia/FLAGS_format.png)

The Overflow flag gets his value, comparing the sign of the operands and the sing of the result, follow this truth table : 


       ADDITION SIGN BITS           SUBTRACTION SIGN BITS              
    num1sign num2sign sumsign    num1sign num2sign sumsign                
    ---------------------------  ---------------------------
     0       0        1           0        1        1
     1       1        0           1        0        0

BOOT/RESET STATUS
-----------------

All registers are set to 0 when the TR3200 boot-up or does a reset.


INSTRUCTIONS FORMAT
-------------------

There is four instruction formats, that could be differentiate by the two MSB
bits.

- Form P3 : Three parameter instruction format
- Form P2 : Two parameter instruction format
- Form P1 : One parameter instruction format
- Form NP : No parameter instruction format

[![Instruction Format Diagram](img/dia/TR3200_ins_format.png "InstructionFormatDia")](img/dia/TR3200_ins_format.png)

### P3 - Instructions with 3 parameters
This format is usual for ALU  that does "a = b op c" and Load/Store instructions
that does indexed access.

Where :

- ooooooo is the instruction OpCode
- M indicates that Rn is an IMMEDIATE value
- Rn is a source register (only the LSB 4 bits) or an IMMEDIATE value if M bit is 1
- Rs is a source register
- Rd is the target register

If the M bit is 1, Rn acts like a immediate value in complement two, from 16383 to -16383. 
Value -16384 (0x4000) is a special value that indicates that the next dword is used 
as 32 bit immediate value.

Do the subtraction of Rn - (Rs + CF) (Carry Bit) and put it on Rd. 

Rd = Rn - (Rs + CF) = (Rn - Rs) - CF
  

    MUL  Rd, Rs, Rn
    SMUL Rd, Rs, Rn

Do the 32x32=64 bit unsigned multiplication of Rs * Rn. Stores the 32 bit MSB in the Y register. 
The LSB 32 bits are stored in Rd. SMUL does the signed operation.

Y:Rd = Rs * Rn


    DIV  Rd, Rs, Rn
    SDIV Rd, Rs, Rn

Does the unsigned integer 32/32 bit division of Rs / Rn and stores the quotient in Rd. 
The rest is stored in Y register. SDIV does the signed operation.
If a division error happens the Division Error flag  will be set to 1.

Rd = Rs / Rn

Y = Rs % Rn


SKIP OPERATIONS
--------------------

  The skip instructions, realizes a comparison between two values If the test
  fails, the next instruction is skiped. The conditional opcodes take one cycle
  longer to perform if the test fails.

  When they skip a conditional instruction, they will skip an additional
  instruction at the cost of one extra cycle. This continues until a non-
  conditional instruction has been skipped. This lets you easily chain
  conditionals. Interrupts are not triggered while the TR3200  is skipping.
  
  
    IFEQ Rd, Rn      Executes next if Rd == Rn
    IFNEQ Rd, Rn     Executes next if Rd <> Rn

    IFL Rd, Rn       Executes next if Rd <  Rn (unsigned ints)
    IFLE Rd, Rn      Executes next if Rd <= Rn (unsigned ints)
    IFSL Rd, Rn      Executes next if Rd <  Rn (signed ints)
    IFSLE Rd, Rn     Executes next if Rd <= Rn (signed ints)
    
    IFBITS Rd, Rn    Execute next if (Rd &  Rn) != 0 (bitwise AND operation)
    IFCLEAR Rd, Rn   Execute next if (Rd &  Rn) == 0 (bitwise AND operation)


JUMP/CALL INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
JUMP and CALL instructions ignores the two LSB bits of the resulting new %pc 
values to enforce code alignment to 4 byte boundary. So is impossible set %pc at 
address that not is multiple of 4, and avoiding penalty for fetching code from
these addresses.

Absolute Jump Instructions:

    JMP Rd + Rn         Jumps to Rd + Rn.    (Absolute)
    JMP Rn              Jumps to Rn.   (Relative)
    
Relative Jump Instructions:

    RJMP Rd             Jumps to %pc + Rn.   (Relative)
    
Absolute Call Instructions:

    CALL Rd + Rn        Jumps to Rd + Rn, and Push PC to the stack.
    CALL Rn             Jumps to Rn and Push PC to the stack.

Relative Call Instructions:

    RCALL Rn            Jumps to %pc + Rn, and Push PC to the stack.
    
Return from Call:

    RET                 Pops %pc from the stack and set %pc to these value.


STACK INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

    PUSH Rn       

Writes a dword value to the stack. As the TR3200 is little endian, It push each byte 
of dword value to the stack, so the %sp register decrements by 4.
  
    POP Rn
  
Reads from the stack a dword value and stores it in the Rn. As the TR3200 is little endian,
It pops each byte of dword value from the stack, so the %sp register by 4.

Note that all stack operations writes/reads **ALWAYS** a dword.


SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

    NOP                  Same that MOV %r0, %r0. Does nothing
    SLEEP                Sleeps the CPU and wakes when an hardware interrupt is triggered
    
 
INTERRUPT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

    INT Rn               Triggers a software interrupt with message Rn.

    RFI                  Return from interrupt. Pops PC and pops %r0. 
                         Also cleans INTERRUPT FLAG and IACK signal.

  

INTERRUPTS
==========    

The TR3200 uses a hybrid of interrupt vector table and interrupt polling as interrupt handle scheme.
The **%ia** register points to a table of 256 pointers were are store the addresses of ISR. To select the entry used, the TR3200 gets the LSB of the interrupt message as table index, and the TR3200 jumps to the address that is stored in that entry. %r0 stores the full interrupt message, giving more information about who and why interrupt as been generated. The Vector table pointed by %ia have a size of 1024 bytes as uses a dword per each entry.

When the **EI** bit on FLAGS register is enable, then the interrupts are enabled. 
Interrupts can be generated by software by INT instruction or by hardware 
getting to Low the INT line. An interrupt is processed when the TR3200  
is ready to process a new instruction (instructions are atomic). When an 
interrupt is being processed, the IACQ line goes to high indicating that the 
TR3200 will ignore the INT line or any software interrupt. This means that all 
interrupts are execute as critical code.

When a Interrupt happens, the TR3200 puts IACK signal to High, gets the address from the table pointed by **%ia**, push to the  stack the values of %r0 and PC registers, sets %r0 and PC, and sets the 
INTERRUPT FLAG to 1. If it's a software interrupt, the message is put on %r0 to 
be processed. If it's a hardware interrupt, sets %r0 to value read in the data 
bus. (%r0 contains always the message from software or hardware interrupt)

When the interrupt service routine ends executing a RFI, the TR3200 pops PC and
%r0 registers, sets IACK (Interrupt Acknowledge) signal to Low, and the 
INTERRUPT FLAG is set to 0.

When a software interrupt is launched but **EI** is disable or the TR3200 is 
processing a interrupt, the INT instruction will take 6 cycles to execute, but 
will act as a NOP.

When the address in the entry of the vector table is 0, then the TR3200 will abort the interrupt like if **EI** is disable.

INTERRUPT LIST
--------------

The interrupt messages should be defined by hardware devices specs. But there a
few interrupts (called Traps) that could be launched by the TR3200 itself, when meets some
special conditions. Actually TR3200 only implements a trap:

- If single-step mode is active (**ESS** bit is enable) and INTERRUPT FLAG is not 
enable, the TR3200  will throw an interrupt with message 0, when executes any 
instruction.


HARDWARE
========  

The TR3200 handles hardware devices as memory mapped. The usual addresses uses by
the devices begins at 0xFF000000, that is the last 16 megabyte of the address space. 


EXAMPLE MEMORY MAP
------------------

The memory map is defined by the OS and computer architecture, but here we give
a example memory map for a 128KiB RAM+ 32KiB ROM :


[![Example Memory Map](img/dia/memory_map.png "MemoryMap")](img/dia/memory_map.png)


ELECTRICAL SIGNALS
==================

- Data Bus (Input/Output) of 32 bits
- Address Bus (Input/Output) of 32 bits
- R/W (Output): Low to signal that the CPU ask to read an address, High to
  signal that the CPU writes an address.
- _INT (Input): Used to signal the CPU that a hardware interrupt is happening
- IACQ (Output): Indicates that the CPU is processing an interrupt and will not
  accept new interrupts. Only can accept new interrupts if is low.
- _RESET (Input): Resets the CPU state if a edge from High to Low hapens.
- _Wait (Input): Makes to the CPU wait at actual stage. Used to arbitrate in
  multi-cpu systems and DMA use of the bus.
- AD_ACT (Output): Indicates that the CPU is using the Address and Data bus


PROTOCOLS
---------

### Sending an interrupt

1.   Pull down _INT line only if IACQ is low
2.   Wait to IACQ gets High
3.   When IACQ gets High, put at data bus the interrupt message.
4.   Release _INT line
5.   Wait to IACQ gets Low -> End Of Interrupt (EOI)
